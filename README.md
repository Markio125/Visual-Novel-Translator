This is a project that uses OCR and a Seq-2-Seq LLM model to translate Japanese text to English, with the primary objective of reading untranslated Visual Novels.

The model needs to be downloaded locally, and can be done by running the model_download file once.
Whenever running the program, you will first have to run server.py to locally start the model.
Then run main.py, and it will start working.

Enjoy.
